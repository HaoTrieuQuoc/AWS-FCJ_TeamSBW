During my internship at AWS First Cloud Journey from September 7, 2025 to December 24, 2025, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.
I participated in leading the development of a Batch Clickstream Analytics Platform on AWS for an e-commerce website (end-to-end ingestion → batch ETL → data warehouse → analytics dashboards), through which I improved my skills in AWS solution architecture (VPC, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, EC2), backend programming (Node.js), data engineering & batch ETL design, PostgreSQL (OLTP & DWH modeling/querying), R Shiny dashboard deployment, cloud security & networking (private subnets, NAT strategy), troubleshooting/debugging, technical documentation, and team leadership/communication.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
