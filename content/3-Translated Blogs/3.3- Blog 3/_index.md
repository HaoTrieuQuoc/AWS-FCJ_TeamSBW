A strong presence at the [devcom developer conference](https://www.devcom.global/) and [gamescom](https://www.gamescom.global/en) this year underscored a thriving video games industry. Held in Cologne, Germany, both events reported record-breaking attendance in 2025, with [devcom receiving 5,400 visitors](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/devcom-2025-attendance-up-6-from-2024) and consumer-focused [gamescom attracting 357,000 attendees](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/357000-visitors-attended-gamescom-2025?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=we-got-rejected-by-everybody-thatgamecompany-on-the-difficulties-and-opportunities-of-transmedia&mc_cid=47a694d415&mc_eid=6bd6cbedfb) The Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Games team showed up in force, hosted in-depth sessions and demos, and connected with customers and partners across the industry.

### **Next-generation experiences take center stage**

At devcom, AWS showcased how game developers can build a scalable browser-based game streaming platform and deliver AAA games at 1080p and 60 FPS using [Amazon GameLift Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/streams/). [The demo](https://aws.amazon.com/gametech/events/gdc2025/demo-showcase/game-streaming-using-amazon-gamelift-streams/) combined this new capability with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), Amazon Simple Storage Service ([Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)), and [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). Attendees could see how this architecture enables secure, low-latency game streaming without downloads—turning phones, tablets, and PCs into powerful gaming devices.

AWS also demonstrated how easy it is to run any multiplayer game project on [Amazon GameLift Servers](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/servers/) using a new container feature. Packaging and deployment automation becomes simple and fast for projects with the Containers Starter Kit for Amazon GameLift, enabling faster iteration without requiring local tool installation.

AWS Partner demos included leveraging the power of the AI-assisted quality assurance solution Razer QA Co-AI to enhance bug detection, and highlighting how global releases can be supported without slowing production using the Phrase Platform for continuous game localization. By integrating directly with tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, GitHub, and more, the platform helps game developers easily manage and automate translation across every content layer—from UI to in-game dialogue. AWS also showcased AI-powered game solutions from Globant, which streamline asset operations within established game industry pipelines, and how devtodev by Appsflyer delivers deeper insights into the player journey.

**Celebrating women’s achievements in the games industry**

A highlight of the conference was AWS, Amazon Games, and EPAM Systems hosting the third Women in Games panel and networking event on Monday, August 18\. The occasion also marked the 20th anniversary of Women in Games International (WIGI), a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing economic equality and diversity in the global games industry. A standout moment of the evening was a lively panel featuring Nika Nour from Savvy Games, Saumya Singh, CEO of WinZO, and Bibbi Wikman, founder of Playcap, moderated by Joanie Kraut, CEO of WIGI.

**Forward-looking discussions that foster community**

On Tuesday, August 19, AWS hosted two Community Clubhouse sessions focused on generative AI and data-driven decision-making.

Moderated by Shayan Sanyal, AWS Global Games Industry Business Development Lead, the session Beyond the Code: The Human Touch in AI-Driven Game Design explored the intersection of human creativity, machine learning, and simulation tools in developing unique visual styles, prototyping game systems, and building compelling narratives. Panelists included Irena Pereira, Founder, CEO, and Creative Director of Unleashed Games; Kayla Comalli, CEO of Lovelace Studio; Mike Fischer, Executive Advisor at KRAFTON; and Adam Boyes, CEO and Founder of Vivrato. The discussion covered how AI-assisted workflows can accelerate content creation and system modeling, while emphasizing the continued importance of creative direction and world-building.

The session Telemetry-Driven Dev Building feedback loops for live games brought together industry veterans to dive into how data can drive better game design, team performance, and business outcomes. Andrei Muratov, AWS Head of Game Analytics and AI, along with Josh Loveridge, Director at Stratton Studios, and Oscar Clark, Chief Strategy Officer at Arcanix, discussed in depth why successful games are shaped by smart, timely data. Key takeaways included: data-driven decision-making from day one, rethinking KPIs, building sustainable and ethical teams, implementing practical game analytics, and real-world examples of how analytics informs product direction, monetization strategy, and player retention.
