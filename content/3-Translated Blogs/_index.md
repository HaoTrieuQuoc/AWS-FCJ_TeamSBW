This section will list and introduce the blogs I have translated. For example:

### Content
#### Blog 1 – Unified customer story with Amazon Connect Cases & Tasks

This post explains how the “customer story” is often fragmented across multiple channels (call/chat/email), causing agents to lack context, miss follow-up actions, and force customers to repeat information. Amazon Connect Cases + Tasks helps consolidate all interactions into a unified workspace, track end-to-end resolution progress, measure performance with KPI/metrics, and optimize costs with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. The post also provides real-world examples (Arbonne, Orbit Irrigation) to demonstrate cost reduction and improved experience.

#### Blog 2 – Right-size Kubernetes resources with metrics-based GitOps + Amazon Bedrock

This post presents how to optimize CPU/memory requests & limits on Amazon EKS using a non-intrusive approach (running outside the cluster), based on Prometheus metrics and the GitOps workflow. A scheduled workflow analyzes metrics, renders manifests (Argo CD), applies changes to the correct source files (Helm/Kustomize/manifest), and automatically opens a Pull Request; Amazon Bedrock helps explain the changes and write the PR description. The goal is to reduce resource waste, control costs, and still keep Git as the “source of truth”.

#### Blog 3 – AWS recap of a record-breaking week at devcom & gamescom 2025

This post summarizes the highlights from AWS for Games at devcom and gamescom 2025: a browser-based game streaming demo with Amazon GameLift Streams combined with Lambda/API Gateway/S3/CloudFront, the ability to run multiplayer game projects on GameLift Servers using containers, and partner demos covering QA AI, localization, and analytics. It also features community highlights such as the Women in Games event and Community Clubhouse sessions on GenAI and telemetry/data-driven development. In closing, AWS emphasizes the tools and infrastructure needed to accelerate game development and operations.
