**Unified customer story: Unlock a single source of truth for customer issues with Amazon Connect Cases and Tasks**  
Authors: Ayesha Borker and Luther Fan | Date: September 11, 2025 | In: [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/category/messaging/amazon-connect/), [Thought Leadership](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/category/post-types/thought-leadership/)

Imagine a situation where a customer calls an organization to report a billing issue. A contact center agent resolves it, but three days later the same customer emails about a related problem. Another agent handles the email, has no information about the prior call, and asks the customer to explain everything again from the beginning. Meanwhile, a promised follow-up task is forgotten in someone’s inbox, and the compliance team has no audit trail of what happened.

Situations like this play out at scale every day in organizations worldwide, contributing to millions of dollars in annual losses due to poor customer service. In most contact centers, the customer story is fragmented across disconnected systems: a billing request here, a technical support chat there, a complaint email somewhere else—no thread connecting those touchpoints and no systematic way to track the specific actions required to resolve a complex issue. Agents have to dig through multiple screens to piece together context, while critical follow-up tasks slip through the cracks—leaving customers frustrated that they must repeat themselves and with no transparency into resolution progress.

Yet most companies are still managing complex customer issues with cumbersome, clunky tools—tools that themselves create friction that damages customer relationships and burns out contact center agents.

### **Resolving customer issues at scale with Amazon Connect Cases and Tasks**

[Amazon Connect Cases](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/cases/) reimagines how modern organizations should handle complex customer issues. As a native feature of Amazon Connect—AWS’s cloud contact center solution—Cases provides a unified workspace where agents can track, collaborate on, and resolve customer issues that span multiple interactions, channels, and team members. Unlike traditional case management systems that operate in silos and require complex integrations, Amazon Connect Cases gives agents a complete timeline of all customer interactions—calls, chats, emails, and tasks—all in a single unified interface.

What sets Amazon Connect Cases apart is its seamless integration with [Amazon Connect Tasks](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/tasks/), creating a powerful combination that tracks both the overall customer issue and the individual work items required to resolve it. When a customer contacts the organization, agents immediately see the full history and status of all ongoing issues, while Tasks ensures every follow-up action is captured, assigned, and tracked through completion.

[Arbonne](https://www.arbonne.com/us/en) is a global leader in beauty and wellness, offering vegan, high-quality products that are cruelty-free. The company saw an opportunity to improve the agent experience by replacing fragmented contact center systems—including separate customer relationship management (CRM) services. They implemented [Amazon Connect including Cases and Tasks in 90 days](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/success/arbonne-neuraflash/), reducing contact center operating costs by 25% and replacing four legacy systems with a single unified solution.

“I can’t believe one solution can do it all,” **said Rolando Salinas, Senior Director of Global Customer Care at Arbonne.** “After my third call with AWS, I believed Amazon Connect could deliver what we needed. By using Amazon Connect, Arbonne created a smarter, more efficient, and scalable contact center solution. Amazon Connect is now the central hub where agents communicate with customers and consultants through a multichannel experience. Amazon Connect Tasks automates and prioritizes agents’ work items, while Amazon Connect Cases helps them track and resolve customer issues that require multiple interactions.”

With Amazon Connect, contact center agents can get started with just a few clicks. This removes the stress of deploying third-party tools, custom integrations, or lengthy implementations, because Amazon Connect Cases is already embedded within your contact center infrastructure.

**From first contact to final resolution: Track the end-to-end journey of every customer issue**

For customer experience leaders, Amazon Connect Cases solves the core problem of context loss—something that makes modern service organizations struggle. Customer effort scores rise when agents lack information about ongoing issues, forcing customers to repeat themselves across channels and interactions. Cases can easily capture and update case information from IVR and chatbot interactions so that, when agent support is needed, the contact is routed to an available agent with the relevant case attached—improving average handle time and first-contact resolution rates. Using the [flow designer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-contact-flows.html), organizations can easily [create, update, and check the status of cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/cases-block.html) within self-service experiences (such as IVR and chatbots), enabling customers to conveniently look up the status of their request.

The impact is immediate and measurable across many scenarios. Consider a financial services company handling fraud investigations: when a customer calls about suspicious charges, an agent can instantly view the full case history from previous calls, security questions asked, temporary cards issued, and pending investigation tasks. Instead of asking the customer to repeat previously provided security information, the agent can focus on resolution. Or imagine a government benefits office where a citizen’s disability claim spans months and involves multiple departments. With Amazon Connect Cases, a citizen calling for an update can receive status information through automated self-service, and if they need an agent, that agent immediately sees the case status, missing documents, and next steps—eliminating the frustrating “let me transfer you” experience.

With Amazon Connect’s multichannel self-service and agent productivity capabilities, [they reduced average handle time (AHT) by 15% and doubled the number of contacts each agent handled per hour.](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/customers/)

“We started using Amazon Connect for customer support in 2021 and immediately loved having a single multichannel solution. However, we were still using a third-party CRM system and quickly realized it couldn’t support the callback model, case workflow, and reporting we needed to support customers effectively across multiple channels and automate processes. After attending an Amazon Connect workshop, we decided to take advantage of the full set of built-in Amazon Connect capabilities. By using the Amazon Connect agent workspace with built-in case management, we avoided the time and cost of building a custom agent desktop and took only three months to deploy the solution after we began configuration.” – **Brian Dick, Senior Manager of Customer Care, Orbit Irrigation**.

**Operational excellence through measurable performance metrics and a usage-based pricing model**

Operations leaders find Amazon Connect Cases compelling because it addresses inefficient case handling that drives high operating costs, longer resolution times, and poor resource allocation across teams. In addition, contact centers have traditionally used third-party case management solutions with fixed, per-seat pricing. This often creates major inefficiencies when organizations pay for every agent seat regardless of how frequently it’s used. This is especially costly for teams with part-time agents, seasonal demand, or fluctuating case volume—resulting in underutilized licenses and unnecessary spend.

Unlike traditional per-seat licensing models that charge based on potential capacity, Amazon Connect offers transparent [pay-as-you go pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/) per case created, with no license fees or upfront costs. This model lets contact centers align costs with actual usage, providing greater flexibility to scale resources up or down as needed. This approach supports more agile operations and helps avoid overpaying for idle capacity—meaning you pay for real value delivered, not forecasted usage.

In addition, Amazon Connect provides clear ownership and accountability, with measurable performance metrics tied to resolution—not just response. Contact center managers can view organizational [key metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/case-management-metrics.html) such as first-contact case resolution rate or case reopen rate, while built-in analytics track average case resolution time, average contacts per case, total cases created, and the percentage of cases resolved on first contact. These comprehensive metrics help managers quickly identify delays in closing cases for specific case types and take action to accelerate resolution and improve customer satisfaction. These integrated metrics also help organizations understand the true cost of case handling and optimize processes for maximum efficiency.

**Eliminate silos, empower agents, and simplify the technology stack**

Contact center directors and IT leaders value how Cases tackles two critical challenges at once: agent productivity and technology complexity. Previously, agents had to juggle multiple applications, lose track of follow-up work, and lacked visibility into prioritization and case workload distribution. Cases delivers a single unified workspace where agents can view all case-related information, create and assign tasks, and collaborate seamlessly with other teams.

Technology simplification is equally compelling. Traditional case management requires complex integrations, costly customizations, and ongoing maintenance across multiple vendors. This feature provides [real-time case event streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/case-event-streams.html) to integrate with data lakes and analytics platforms. In addition, [Amazon Connect Contact Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/) rules can automatically notify supervisors when a case is updated or [breaches an SLA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/create-alerts-on-cases.html#conditions-alerts-on-cases). This intelligent integration ensures cases are automatically categorized and prioritized for the right teams based on what is happening in the customer conversation—creating a case management system that responds dynamically to customer needs in real time.

**Applications across vertical industries**

Cases and Tasks adapt to diverse industry needs: financial services use them for fraud investigations, loan processing, and compliance with full audit trails; healthcare organizations manage care coordination, insurance requests, and HIPAA compliance documentation; government agencies handle citizen services, benefits administration, and cross-agency incident response; while technology companies coordinate complex technical support, security investigations, and customer feedback integration with engineering teams. This flexibility allows organizations to tailor workflows to their unique business processes, rather than forcing operations to conform to rigid software constraints.

The road ahead

Amazon Connect doesn’t just help manage customer issues—it transforms how organizations deliver customer experiences. With transparent pricing, rapid deployment, and proven outcomes, organizations are quickly capturing the competitive advantage that comes from superior customer service capabilities with Amazon Connect.
