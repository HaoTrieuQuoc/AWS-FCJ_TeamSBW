# “AWS FIRST CLOUD JOURNEY COMMUNITY DAY 2025”

**Venue:** Bitexco Financial Tower  
**Date:** Saturday, 30 August 2025  

## Event Objectives
- Strengthen the AWS community through knowledge sharing and networking
- Showcase practical GenAI use cases across Enterprise, Academic, and Banking domains
- Share implementation approaches for chatbots, RAG, and multi-agent automation on AWS
- Encourage builders to apply modern cloud patterns (serverless, event-driven thinking) in real projects

- **Việt Lý** – Speaker (AWS Partner / Cloud & AI session)

## Key Highlights

### Opening & Community Direction
- Opening remarks: event introduction, community vision & objectives, welcome message
- Coffee networking: connecting with builders, sharing learning paths, and discussing real AWS projects

### Enterprise Chatbot: Unlocking Context with MCP on AWS
- Building an enterprise chatbot with **advanced context handling**
- MCP concept: improving how the assistant accesses, controls, and uses context safely
- AWS implementation + live demo + practical lessons learned for production readiness

### GenAI Kitchen Recipe Recommendation System
- Personalized recipe recommendation using GenAI
- Emphasis on **workflow design** on AWS to connect data → recommendation logic → user experience
- Demo showcase and discussion about how personalization can be evaluated and improved

### Internal Chatbot with RAG on AWS Serverless
- RAG approach: **retrieve relevant knowledge → generate accurate answers**
- Building internal FAQ/knowledge base chatbot using a **fully serverless** AWS architecture
- Realistic enterprise/internal use cases (policies, onboarding docs, operational Q&A)

### GenAI Multi-Agent Systems for Process Automation
- Multi-agent architecture: splitting automation into specialized roles (planner/worker/tool-user, etc.)
- Orchestrating agents with serverless workflows to automate processes reliably
- Banking scenarios: automation for repetitive workflows, approvals, and information handling

### GenAI with Kiro IDE & Strands Agent
- GenAI in production and R&D: turning ideas into working prototypes faster
- Workflow orchestration mindset for multi-step GenAI tasks (not just single prompts)
- Multi-agent demo and how tooling can boost developer productivity

## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset
- Start from the problem and audience (enterprise vs academic vs banking) before choosing tools
- Prioritize practical demos and lessons learned to shorten the build–test–iterate loop
- Use a community mindset: share patterns, reusable building blocks, and trade-offs openly

### Technical Architecture
- RAG is a strong pattern for internal knowledge/FAQ chatbots where information is large and changes often
- Serverless architectures help ship GenAI prototypes faster with less operational overhead
- Multi-agent systems fit process automation when tasks can be decomposed into roles, steps, and tool-calls
- Workflow orchestration is crucial for reliability when GenAI systems involve multiple stages (retrieve → reason → act → respond)

### Applying to Work
- Build a small internal RAG chatbot for docs/FAQs as a pilot (measure usefulness + maintenance effort)
- Prototype a multi-agent workflow for automation use cases (triage, reporting, internal operations)
- Collect “lessons learned” from demos into reusable templates (architecture checklist, prompt patterns, observability, cost control)
- Run internal sharing sessions similar to community events to spread common language and best practices

## Event Experience
Attending the “AWS First Cloud Journey Community Day 2025” was valuable because it provided real examples of how GenAI solutions are being built on AWS in different domains. Key experiences included:

- **Learning from speakers across industries**
  - The sessions covered enterprise chatbot context handling, academic recommendation systems, and banking-grade internal chatbots.
  - Seeing multiple perspectives helped me understand how the same GenAI foundation can be adapted to different constraints and goals.

- **Hands-on inspiration from demos**
  - Live demos and architecture discussions clarified how to structure solutions using serverless, RAG, and orchestration.
  - I learned practical ways to think about building reliable GenAI workflows beyond just “calling an LLM”.

- **Networking and discussions**
  - The event created opportunities to exchange ideas with peers, learn real implementation trade-offs, and discover reusable patterns.
  - It reinforced the importance of community-driven learning and sharing practical cloud knowledge.

- **Lessons learned**
  - RAG + serverless is a practical combination for internal knowledge systems that need fast iteration and scalability.
  - Multi-agent approaches are promising for automation when paired with clear workflow design and guardrails.
  - Real demos and lessons learned accelerate learning far more than theory alone.
