## Week 10 Achievements

### 1. Docker & LocalStack Preparation
- Researched how to set up Docker for packaging Python libraries and LocalStack-related services.  
- Studied different **library versions** to ensure compatibility before containerization.  
- Tested LocalStack services in a local environment to confirm stability before moving into Docker.

---

### 2. Updated System Architecture (v9)
- Revised architecture to match project goals and AWS services more accurately.  
- Improved flow between CloudFront, Amplify, S3, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, EventBridge, and EC2-based Data Warehouse.  
- Adjusted database integration with PostgreSQL and clickstream pipeline placement.

---

### 3. Documentation & Vietnamese Revision
- Updated and refined the **Vietnamese version** of the proposal to maintain consistency and clarity.  
- Identified missing details and corrected overall content structure.

---

### 4. New Proposal Template (DOCX)
